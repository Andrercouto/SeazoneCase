# Case Seazone - Data Scientist

The actual repository encompasses a testing Case for a data scientist job opportunity at Seazone. The Case was designed for testing both the coding skills, logical thinking and analytical capabilities, and it's based on a work done at Seazone, with real data and it's divided in two parts. Its first part consists on treating (wrangling, enriching, modeling) the raw data, while the second part is based on getting insights from the modeled data in order to make better strategic decisions.
